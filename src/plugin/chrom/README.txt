Introduction:
A open source(under LGPL) library for API/Function interception/hooking. It can
be used as an alternative to Microsoft Research's detours. The idea behind both
is similar, but difference arise from scope of use & the license terms. where as
you can't modify the source of the detours, you can do that in Chrom as
specified in LGPL, Chrom can be used in both free/opensource and proprietary
applications.
